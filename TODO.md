# TODO

This document is essentially a list of shorthand notes describing work yet to be completed.
Unfortunately it is not complete enough for other people to pick work off the list and
complete as there is too much un-said.

* Optionally generate statistics and logging for each annotation pass indicating:
  * how many types were deferred in each round and in total.
  * how many types were pulled from deferred in each round and in total.
  * how many warnings were generated in each round and in total.
  * how many types were emitted in each round and in total.
  * how long each type took and how long each round took and how long it took in total.
